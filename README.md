This project will be evaluating the variables in home prices based on a group of 79 certain variabesl. In this project we are going to try to determine how to predict housing prices based on home variables.

## EDA (EXPLATORY DATA ANALYIS)
Looking at the data, what I'm going to need to do is make it so I can do some missing values data, some EDA, will need to do some major feature selction in order to get this project to run smoothly.

Feature selection is the automatic selection of attributes in the data that are most relevant to the predictive modeling. This is done by reducing the number

Now that the data has been converted to numeric values, we can begin doing some correlation analysis. The first is the scatterplot below.
